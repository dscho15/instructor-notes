% The file %dataset_problem_6_1.mat  contains data for the measured characteristics of 76 young bulls 
% (less than two years old) sold at an auction.  The univariate (scalar) response variable, Y, is the bull%s height in [inches] 
% at shoulder at the time of the sale.  The two predictor variables, collected in the matrix, Z, is the bull s yearling (one year old) 
% height in [inches] at shoulder and the bullâ€™s fat free body weight in [pounds], respectively
